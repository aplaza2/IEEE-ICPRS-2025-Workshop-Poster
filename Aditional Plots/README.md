## Aditional Plots

We evaluated the models using the following metrics: **HitRate@10**, **MRR@10**, **NDCG@10**, **Precision@10**, and **Recall@10**. Since all metrics showed very similar comparative trends across models, we decided to report only **NDCG@10** in the poster for clarity.

This folder contains additional plots, including:
- Emission rate over training time  
- Sensitivity to optimizer (learner) and learning rate  
- Combined comparison plots  
- Sensitivity analysis for train batch size
